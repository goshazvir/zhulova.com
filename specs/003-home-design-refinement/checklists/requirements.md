# Specification Quality Checklist: Home Page Design Refinement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality checks completed successfully

**Details**:
- **Content Quality**: All sections are user-focused and technology-agnostic. Successfully describes WHAT and WHY without HOW.
- **Requirements**: All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are clear, testable, and unambiguous.
- **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) are measurable and technology-agnostic.
- **User Stories**: 5 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios, independent tests, and clear value propositions.
- **Edge Cases**: 6 edge cases identified covering scalability, device variations, and accessibility.
- **Scope**: Clearly defined with detailed "Out of Scope" section listing 8 excluded items.
- **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements are sufficiently clear for planning phase.

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No revisions needed.
